Part 7: Matthew Rose Sorensen

The news hits on November 18, 2018 that Valentine Ketterley has disappeared. A young officer, Jamie Askill, thinks that it is linked to the reappearance of Matthew Sorenson, and that Sorenson was being held captive. He goes to question Piranesi. Piranesi offers truthful, but misleading answers which imply that Jamie’s theory is incorrect.

Piranesi goes back to live with his family. He considers himself to be neither “Piranesi” or “Michael Rose Sorenson”. Instead, he is simply himself and those other two people are parts of him. Now that he knows how to get in and out, Piranesi goes back to visit the House frequently. He also he goes to find James Ritter, and together they go back to the labyrinth to visit. He goes to visit it with Raphael as well, someone he now cares for deeply considering how brave it was for her to try to rescue him.

A part of him still considers the House to be his home. As he wanders around the city, he sees people he recognizes from the statues in the House. The book ends with a thought he re-iterates from earlier on in the book, saying “The Beauty of the House is immeasurable; its Kindness infinite.”

Piranesi notices that the House depicts people differently than what they are from real life. It may be that, because everything is the House is derived from ideas in the real world, that the statue version of that person is how someone sees that person. So, when Piranesi sees a random man who is depicted as a king in a statue in the House, it may be because someone out there sees that man that way.

Piranesi and James were both tricked into being captives of the House, but they both had a fondness for it as well. The book ends with a positive note about House. Despite the circumstances that brought him there, there is a beauty about the House, free from the vices of people and ultimate the House made Piranesi a kinder and more humble person.
