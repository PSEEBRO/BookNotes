Part 5: Valentine Ketterley

In “The events of 15 November 2012”, Piranesi describes visiting Ketterley in mid-November 2012. Piranesi identifies himself as Matthew Rose Sorenson, and they discuss Laurence Arne-Sayles. Ketterley describes Laurence as being perverse, shameless and cruel. Ketterley also admits that he thinks that he thought he’d seen the other World once. He offers to show Sorenson by performing a ritual. Sorenson agrees, and it occurs to him as Ketterley begins this ritual that it is clearly something Ketterley has done not once, but many times before.

Suddenly, Piranesi finds himself in the House, and Ketterley laughs and laughs, saying that he’s delighted, because “a young, healthy man is just what I wanted”.

Throughout the conversation with Piranesi, there are foreboding hints throughout it of what’s to come. Ketterley comments on Sorenson’s diligence record-keeping (which is something the Other finds very useful). And when they start to talk about the doorways to the other World, Ketterley asks if anyone else knows he’s here. When Piranesi says no, that’s when he offers to do a ritual to show him. He tells Piranesi to bring his journals. Of course, this all ends with Piranesi being trapped down there.
